description: Begin implementing a planned feature following spec-kit workflow
---

Let's begin implementing a feature following the spec-driven development workflow.

**Implementation Process:**

1. **Verify Prerequisites:**
   - Specification exists in `.specify/specs/`
   - Implementation plan exists in `.specify/artifacts/`
   - Constitution principles are understood

2. **Review Before Starting:**
   - Read the specification
   - Review the implementation plan
   - Understand acceptance criteria

3. **Implementation Guidelines:**
   - Follow constitution principles
   - Complete tasks in planned order
   - Update task status as you progress
   - Run tests after each significant change
   - Commit logical units of work

4. **Quality Checks:**
   - Run `npm run typecheck`
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Test with MCP inspector if applicable
   - Review against specification

5. **Documentation:**
   - Update CLAUDE.md if needed
   - Add code comments for complex logic
   - Update README if user-facing changes

Which feature should I implement? I'll review the spec and plan, then begin implementation following these guidelines.
