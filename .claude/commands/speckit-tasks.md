description: View and manage implementation tasks

Help me manage implementation tasks for the current feature.

**Task Management:**

1. **View Current Tasks:**
   - Show tasks from latest plan in `.specify/artifacts/`
   - Display current status

2. **Update Task Status:**
   - Mark tasks as completed
   - Add new discovered tasks
   - Adjust priorities

3. **Track Progress:**
   - Show completion percentage
   - Identify blockers
   - Estimate remaining work

4. **Save Task State:**
   - Update plan document with current status
   - Log completion notes

Ask me which feature's tasks I want to manage, then show the current task list and status.
