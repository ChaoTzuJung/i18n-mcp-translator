description: Create an implementation plan from a specification
---

Help me create a detailed implementation plan for a feature.

**Process:**

1. **Review Specification:**
   - Read the relevant spec from `.specify/specs/`
   - Confirm understanding of requirements

2. **Break Down Into Tasks:**
   - Identify all code changes needed
   - List files to be created/modified
   - Define order of implementation

3. **Create Implementation Plan:**
   - Step-by-step action items
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Estimated complexity
   - Testing checkpoints

4. **Save Plan:**
   - Save to `.specify/artifacts/plan-[feature-name].md`
   - Include references to relevant spec

5. **Review Against Constitution:**
   - Ensure plan follows project principles
   - Verify quality standards will be met

After creating the plan, ask if I'm ready to begin implementation or if the plan needs adjustment.
